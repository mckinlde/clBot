It sounds like you're facing a performance bottleneck with multiple EC2 instances running your scraper, despite DynamoDB autoscaling and the network handling the load well. Here are some factors to consider for debugging the slowdown:

* 1. EC2 Instance Resource Limits:
CPU and Memory: Check if your EC2 instances are hitting CPU or memory limits. Use CloudWatch metrics to monitor CPU utilization, memory, and disk I/O on each instance. When running multiple scrapers, these resources can be exhausted, even if network and database look fine.
Network I/O on EC2: While your home network is fast, the EC2 instanceâ€™s network bandwidth might be throttled if you're using smaller instance types (like T2, T3). Check the instance type's bandwidth limits, and upgrade if necessary.
* 2. Network Latency and EC2 Bandwidth:
Since you're scraping Craigslist, if all instances are sending requests from the same region/IP range, you might experience throttling or rate-limiting from Craigslist's servers. Try running instances in different AWS regions to see if performance improves.
Check the effective network bandwidth for each instance. You can use tools like iperf or AWS EC2's built-in performance metrics.
* 3. EC2 Inter-Instance Communication (If Applicable):
If the instances are communicating with each other, ensure that the inter-instance traffic isn't consuming excessive resources or causing delays. This is more relevant if they share data via a queue or coordination mechanism.
* 4. Request Throttling on Craigslist:
Craigslist might throttle requests if they detect a large volume from a single IP range. You can mitigate this by using proxies or rotating your IPs across different regions.
* 5. Check for DynamoDB Throttling or Partition Issues:
Even though DynamoDB reports scaling well, check for partition-related issues. If all instances are writing to the same partition key, DynamoDB might not distribute the load evenly. This can be analyzed by looking at hot partitions in DynamoDB metrics.
* 6. Python GIL or Async Bottleneck:
If you're running synchronous Python code, especially if it involves I/O-bound tasks (like web scraping), you might be hitting the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL). Switching to an asynchronous model (using asyncio, aiohttp, etc.) might improve the situation.
* 7. AWS Limits or Throttling:
AWS might impose limits on the number of concurrent requests your EC2 instances can make (per region or per service). Check if you are hitting service limits and request increases if necessary.
Steps for Debugging:
Monitor EC2 Metrics: Use CloudWatch to monitor CPU, memory, and network utilization on each instance.
Use Different AWS Regions: Try distributing the instances across different AWS regions to mitigate potential throttling by Craigslist.
Test Async Scraping: If not already using it, consider switching to asynchronous requests with a library like aiohttp to see if that mitigates any bottlenecks.
Network and Throttling Analysis: Analyze the network latency between your EC2 instances and Craigslist using traceroutes or ping to check for possible rate-limiting or latency issues.
