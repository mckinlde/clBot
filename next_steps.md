The script will fail even with just one instance running because dynamoDB doesn't adjust writers fast enough.

To handle the `ProvisionedThroughputExceededException` gracefully, we can introduce a retry mechanism with exponential backoff, and send an email notification when this error occurs. Here's a breakdown of possible improvements:

### 1. **Catch and Retry with Exponential Backoff:**
   - When the `ProvisionedThroughputExceededException` is encountered, retry the `put_item` operation after waiting for a brief period. This period can be progressively increased with each retry (exponential backoff).

### 2. **Email Notification:**
   - When the exception is raised after the maximum retries, send an email notifying you about the error.

### 3. **Handle DynamoDB Auto-scaling:**
   - DynamoDB should automatically scale to meet demand, so you may not need to manually adjust it. However, sending an email alert is a good way to keep track of when the error occurs.

### 4. **Listen for Email Responses:**
   - EC2 instances donâ€™t typically "listen" for emails. However, you could set up a monitoring service where you manually restart the process if notified via email.

Here's how you can modify your `process_frontpage` function:

```python
import time
import random

def process_frontpage(area, driver, get_soup_from_url, extract_frontpage_links, get_html_from_url, soup_from_html, check_listing_activity, retries=5):
    # Fetch the front page soup from the URL
    frontpage_soup = get_soup_from_url(
        driver,
        f'https://{area}.craigslist.org/search/cta?purveyor=owner#search=1~gallery~0~0'
    )

    # Extract links from the front page
    links = extract_frontpage_links(frontpage_soup)

    new_listings_count = 0

    for i, link in enumerate(links, start=1):
        print('Processing frontpage: ', area)
        print('link: ', link)
        print(i, ' of ', len(links))

        link_html = get_html_from_url(driver, link)
        listing_activity = check_listing_activity(soup_from_html(link_html))

        if listing_activity['is_expected']:
            attempt = 0
            while attempt < retries:
                try:
                    # Try to insert the item into DynamoDB
                    table.put_item(
                        Item={
                            'area': area,
                            'url': link,
                            'added': datetime.datetime.now().isoformat(),
                            'activity': 'active',
                            'updated': datetime.datetime.now().isoformat(),
                            'listing_html': link_html
                        }
                    )
                    new_listings_count += 1
                    break  # Exit loop if successful
                except botocore.exceptions.ProvisionedThroughputExceededException as e:
                    attempt += 1
                    wait_time = (2 ** attempt) + random.uniform(0, 1)
                    print(f"ProvisionedThroughputExceededException: Retrying in {wait_time:.2f} seconds (Attempt {attempt}/{retries})")
                    time.sleep(wait_time)  # Exponential backoff

                    if attempt == retries:
                        send_mail(
                            'douglasemckinley@gmail.com',
                            'johnnygooddeals@gmail.com',
                            f"DynamoDB Provisioning Error: {area}",
                            f"Exceeded retries for {link} in area {area} due to provisioning error."
                        )
                        print(f"Failed to insert after {retries} attempts. Sending email alert.")

    return {'new_listings_added': new_listings_count}
```

### Key Enhancements:
- **Exponential Backoff:** If the `ProvisionedThroughputExceededException` occurs, we retry the operation with a progressively longer wait time (`2^attempt`).
- **Email Notification:** If retries are exhausted, an email is sent notifying you of the error.

This approach ensures that your script keeps running even if DynamoDB is temporarily throttled, and it alerts you when manual intervention may be necessary.
