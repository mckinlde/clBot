If your script doesn't ask for input immediately but later on in the execution, the `echo "1"` method might not work as expected, since it provides the input right at the start of the script.

### Solution: Use `expect` to interact with the script

To handle cases where the script prompts for input at a later point, you can use the `expect` tool. This tool is designed to wait for specific prompts from the script and then provide the necessary input.

Hereâ€™s how to set it up:

### Steps:

1. **Install `expect` on your EC2 instance**:

   First, ensure that `expect` is installed. Run the following command:

   ```bash
   sudo yum install expect -y  # For Amazon Linux or RedHat
   ```

   For Ubuntu/Debian:

   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install expect -y
   ```

2. **Create an `expect` script**:

   Create a new file (e.g., `run_seattle_cars.sh`) to automate the interaction with your Python script.

   ```bash
   nano ~/run_seattle_cars.sh
   ```

   Add the following content to the script:

   ```bash
   #!/usr/bin/expect -f

   # Start the Python script
   spawn python3 /path/to/your/script/clot/seattle_cars.py

   # Wait for the prompt where it asks for input
   expect "Your specific prompt or question here"  # Replace this with the actual text that the script displays when it asks for input

   # Send the input "1"
   send "1\r"

   # Continue running the script
   expect eof
   ```

   Replace `"Your specific prompt or question here"` with the actual prompt that the script shows when asking for input.

3. **Make the script executable**:

   Give the script execution permissions:

   ```bash
   chmod +x ~/run_seattle_cars.sh
   ```

4. **Schedule the `expect` script using cron**:

   Now, update your cron job to run the `expect` script at 12:07 AM:

   ```bash
   crontab -e
   ```

   Add the following line:

   ```bash
   7 0 * * * /usr/bin/expect /home/ec2-user/run_seattle_cars.sh
   ```

   - `/usr/bin/expect` is the path to the `expect` interpreter.
   - `/home/ec2-user/run_seattle_cars.sh` is the path to your `expect` script.

5. **Save and verify**:

   After saving and exiting the crontab, verify that your cron job was added:

   ```bash
   crontab -l
   ```

Now, your script will run at 12:07 AM, and the `expect` script will wait for the input prompt and provide the input "1" when required.
