If you are receiving the error `-bash: crontab: command not found`, it means that `cron` is not installed on your EC2 instance. To resolve this, you need to install the `cron` package. Here’s how you can do that based on your EC2 instance's operating system:

### For Amazon Linux or Red Hat-based systems (such as CentOS or Fedora):

1. **Install `cron`**:

   ```bash
   sudo yum install cronie -y
   ```

2. **Start the `cron` service**:

   After installation, start the `cron` service:

   ```bash
   sudo service crond start
   ```

3. **Enable `cron` to start on boot**:

   ```bash
   sudo chkconfig crond on
   ```

4. **Verify the installation**:

   You can verify if `cron` is running by checking its status:

   ```bash
   sudo service crond status
   ```

If your script doesn't ask for input immediately but later on in the execution, the `echo "1"` method might not work as expected, since it provides the input right at the start of the script.

### Solution: Use `expect` to interact with the script

To handle cases where the script prompts for input at a later point, you can use the `expect` tool. This tool is designed to wait for specific prompts from the script and then provide the necessary input.

Here’s how to set it up:

### Steps:

1. **Install `expect` on your EC2 instance**:

   First, ensure that `expect` is installed. Run the following command:

   ```bash
   sudo yum install expect -y  # For Amazon Linux or RedHat
   ```

   For Ubuntu/Debian:

   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install expect -y
   ```

2. **Create an `expect` script**:

   Create a new file (e.g., `run_seattle_cars.sh`) to automate the interaction with your Python script.

   ```bash
   nano ~/run_seattle_cars.sh
   ```

   Add the following content to the script:
   
   ```
   #!/usr/bin/expect -f
   
   # Enable debugging for expect interactions
   exp_internal 1
   
   # Set timeout to 30 seconds
   set timeout 30
   
   # Set up logging for the expect interactions
   log_file -a /home/ec2-user/seattle_cars_error.log
   
   # Start the Python script and redirect both stdout and stderr to the same log
   spawn bash -c "python3 clBot/seattle_cars.py >> /home/ec2-user/seattle_cars_error.log 2>&1"
   
   # Wait for the prompt where it asks for input
   expect {
       -re "Select an area set.*" {
           # Send the input "5"
           send "5\r"
       }
       timeout {
           puts "Error: Timed out waiting for 'Select an area set:' prompt"
           log_file
           exit 1
       }
       eof {
           puts "Error: The script ended unexpectedly"
           log_file
           exit 1
       }
   }
   
   # Continue running the script until it finishes
   expect eof
   
   # Close the log file
   log_file
   ```

   Replace `"Select an area set:"` with the actual prompt that the script shows when asking for input.

4. **Make the script executable**:

   Give the script execution permissions:

   ```bash
   chmod +x ~/run_seattle_cars.sh
   ```

5. **Schedule the `expect` script using cron**:

   Now, update your cron job to run the `expect` script at 12:07 AM:

   ```bash
   crontab -e
   ```

   Add the following line:

   ```bash
   7 0 * * * /usr/bin/expect /home/ec2-user/run_seattle_cars.sh
   ```

   - `/usr/bin/expect` is the path to the `expect` interpreter.
   - `/home/ec2-user/run_seattle_cars.sh` is the path to your `expect` script.

6. **Save and verify**:

   After saving and exiting the crontab, verify that your cron job was added:

   ```bash
   crontab -l
   ```

Now, your script will run at 12:07 AM, and the `expect` script will wait for the input prompt and provide the input "1" when required.
